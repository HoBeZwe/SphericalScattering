## [Duality Relations](@id dualityRelations)

In many places the duality relations
```math
\begin{aligned}
\varepsilon \rightarrow \mu \\
\mu \rightarrow \varepsilon \\
\dots
\end{aligned}
```
are employed in order to compute, e.g., the field of the magnetic current counterparts to the electric currents.
