## [Duality Relations](@id dualityRelations)

In many places the duality relations [[1, p. 120]](@ref refs)

| electric current | ``\rightarrow`` | magnetic current | 
|:---------------: | :-------------: | :--------------: |
| ``\bm e``        | ``\rightarrow`` | ``\bm h``        |
| ``\bm h``        | ``\rightarrow`` | ``-\bm e``       |
| ``\varepsilon``  | ``\rightarrow`` | ``\mu``          |
| ``\mu``          | ``\rightarrow`` | ``\varepsilon``  |

are employed in order to compute, e.g., the field of the magnetic current counterparts to the electric currents.
